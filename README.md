2. ðŸ§® DAX Measures Used

- Averages & Counts
Avg Discount = AVERAGE(orders_clean[Discount])
Avg Profit per Customer = DIVIDE([Total Profit], DISTINCTCOUNT(orders_clean[Customer ID]))
Avg Sales per Customer = DIVIDE([Total Sales], DISTINCTCOUNT(orders_clean[Customer ID]))
Customer Count = DISTINCTCOUNT(orders_clean[Customer Name])

- Rankings
Customer Profit Rank =
RANKX(
    ALL(orders_clean[Customer Name]),
    [Total Profit],
    ,
    DESC,
    DENSE
)

- Profit Calculations
Profit by Category = SUM(orders_clean[Profit])
Profit by Customer = SUM(orders_clean[Profit])
Profit by Region = SUM(orders_clean[Profit])
Profit by Segment = SUM(orders_clean[Profit])
Profit Growth % = DIVIDE([Total Profit] - [Profit LY], [Profit LY])
Profit LY = CALCULATE([Total Profit], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(orders_clean[Order Date]))
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])
Profit MTD = TOTALMTD([Total Profit], orders_clean[Order Date])
Profit YTD = TOTALYTD([Total Profit], orders_clean[Order Date])

- Sales Calculations
Sales by Category = SUM(orders_clean[Sales])
Sales by Region = SUM(orders_clean[Sales])
Sales Growth % = DIVIDE([Total Sales] - [Sales LY], [Sales LY])
Sales LY = CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(orders_clean[Order Date]))
Sales MTD = TOTALMTD([Total Sales], orders_clean[Order Date])
Sales YTD = TOTALYTD([Total Sales], orders_clean[Order Date])

- Totals
Total Profit = SUM(orders_clean[Profit])
Total Qty = SUM(orders_clean[Quantity])
Total Sales = SUM(Orders_Clean[Sales])

- Year-over-Year Growth
YoY Sales Growth % =
VAR CurrentSales = SUM(orders_clean[Sales])
VAR LastYearSales =
    CALCULATE(
        SUM(orders_clean[Sales]),
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('DateTable'[Date])
    )
RETURN
    IF(
        ISBLANK(LastYearSales),
        BLANK(),
        DIVIDE(CurrentSales - LastYearSales, LastYearSales)
    )


ðŸ§® Key DAX Measures
DAX
Total Sales = SUM ( Orders_Clean[Sales] )

Total Profit = SUM ( Orders_Clean[Profit] )

Total Quantity = SUM ( Orders_Clean[Quantity] )

Average Discount = AVERAGE ( Orders_Clean[Discount] )

Profit Margin % = DIVIDE ( [Total Profit], [Total Sales] )

Sales per Customer = DIVIDE ( [Total Sales], DISTINCTCOUNT ( Orders_Clean[Customer ID] ) )
